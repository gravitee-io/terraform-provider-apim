# Create a V4 HTTP proxy API with shared endpoint group configuration

All endpoints inheriting from this configuration (`inherit_configuration = true`) will get:
* Proxy configuration
* Timeouts

You can see that heath check is configured for the endpoint group.
Although it can be overridden for a single endpoint, there will be one health check call for the whole group.

```terraform
{{ .V4ApiSharedEndpointConfig.Content }}
