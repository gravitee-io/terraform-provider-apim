  ## Terraform Ignored
  - target: $.components.schemas.Errors

      x-speakeasy-terraform-ignore: true
  - target: $.components.schemas.PlanV4.properties.order
    description: |
      May not be immediately populated, which can cause import testing errors:

      apiv4_resource_test.go:23: Step 2/2 error running import: ImportStateVerify attributes not equivalent. Difference is shown below. The - symbol indicates attributes missing after import.

        map[string]string{
      +       "plans.Keyless.order": "0",
        }

      This property is unnecessary for Terraform anyways, so it is ignored.
    update:
      x-speakeasy-terraform-ignore: true
